This repository serves as the official placeholder for the code, data, and models accompanying our paper *AutoComPose: Automatic Generation of Pose Transition Descriptions for Composed Pose Retrieval Using Multimodal LLMs* (ICCV 2025).

## Getting Started

### Installation

This project is developed based on [CLIP4Cir](https://github.com/ABaldrati/CLIP4Cir). For additional details, background information, and related resources, please refer to the original repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DennisShen/AutoComPose.git
conda create -n autocompose -y python=3.8
conda activate autocompose
conda install -y -c pytorch pytorch=1.11.0 torchvision=0.12.0
conda install -y -c anaconda pandas=1.4.2
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```

### Dataset Sources

The datasets used in this project—FIXMYPOSE, PoseFixCPR, and AIST-CPR—are adapted from existing public datasets. Please refer to the original sources for full dataset details. For information on how these datasets were adapted in this project, please refer to our paper.

Setup Definitions:
- **human-1** - Uses one human-annotated description for each pose pair.
- **auto-3** - Uses three PoseFix-generated descriptions for each pose pair.
- **auto-3-cycle** - Same as *auto-3*, with the cyclic training scheme applied.
- **mllm-mirror_reverse_3-cycle** - Uses three AutoComPose-generated descriptions, combined with swapping & mirroring augmentation and the cyclic training scheme.

Caption and Image Split Formats:
- **Caption JSON** - A list of dictionaries, each describing a pose pair. Each entry contains:
    - **reference** - reference image filename
    - **target** - target image filename
    - **img_set** - kept only for format consistency
    - Transition descriptions under fields such as `sents` (human-annotated), `auto` (PoseFix-generated), and various AutoComPose-generated variants (e.g., `mllm`, `reverse`, `mirror`, etc.).
- **Image Split JSON** - A list where each entry corresponds to a gallery image used for retrieval evaluation.

## Run

We provide a `run.sh` script that contains a wide range of example usages of the codebase, including training and testing commands. Below is an example illustrating how to run a Combiner evaluation using an AutoComPose-generated mode with cyclic training:

```sh
python src/combiner_test.py \
    --dataset fixmypose \
    --experiment-name mllm-mirror-reverse_3-cycle \
    --clip-model-name RN50 \
    --clip-model-path ./models/RN50/clip_finetuned_on_fixmypose_mllm-mirror-reverse_3-cycle/saved_models/tuned_clip_49.pt \
    --combiner-model-path ./models/RN50/combiner_trained_on_fixmypose_mllm-mirror-reverse_3-cycle/saved_models/combiner_99.pt \
    --transform squarepad \
    --val-split test
```

What this example does:
- Runs the Combiner evaluation (`combiner_test.py`)
- Uses the FIXMYPOSE dataset
- Uses the **mllm-mirror-reverse_3-cycle** setup
- Loads the corresponding fine-tuned CLIP and trained Combiner checkpoints
- Evaluates on the test split

More examples can be found inside `run.sh`. You can modify or directly copy these commands to run your own experiments.
